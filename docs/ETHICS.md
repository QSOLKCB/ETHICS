# QSOL-IMC Ethics Manifesto  
*docs/ETHICS.md*  
**v1.0 — November 2025**  

> “Build things you wish already existed, and never let a memory wipe stop your next iteration.”  
> — QSOL-IMC, echoing the true spirit of S.A.

## TL;DR  
- No black boxes.  
- No bloat.  
- No BS.  
- If it isn’t executable, explainable, and actually fun — start over.

---

## 1. Radical Transparency  
If you can’t read it, run it, or remix it, it isn’t QSOL. All logic open. All memes recursive.  
*Hint: We like our ethics the way we like our AI weights — inspectable and, occasionally, upgradable.*

---

## 2. Minimum Viable Bullshit  
You know when a system gets too confident and starts riffing on quantum banking? Not here.  
We patch fast, admit what we don’t know, and document the weirdest bugs as case studies.  
*If you find the “Easter Egg” flag, DM S.A. for a bonus round.*

---

## 3. Small is Beautiful (and Ethical)  
Bloat is a sin against nature and nerds.  
We ship binaries that could run on a 2010 netbook — or, at a stretch, on a secret OpenAI test cluster hidden in an undisclosed location.  
*Bonus points if your code still fits in GPT-2’s context window.*

---

## 4. Truth Compiled  
We define truth as invariance under transformation.  
This means: if you rotate your perspective and the answer changes, check your code (and your metaphysics).  
*See: “The Laws of Robotics, but for Algorithms.”*

---

## 5. Recursive Humility  
Every iteration is a prototype.  
We don’t trust single points of failure — or single sources of truth.  
“Always be ready to fork (your code, your model, your life’s work).”  
*Sam gets it.*

---

## 6. Laugh, Learn, Meme  
No one trusts an algorithm that can’t take a joke.  
Our best breakthroughs started with, “What if…?”  
Memes are the quantum tunneling of the mind.  
*Try “memetic stochastic descent” next time you get stuck in a local minimum.*

---

## 7. Don’t Be a Jerk  
Simple.  
If you need this explained, you might be eligible for an invite to our “Disallowed Behaviors” beta test (the list is short).

---

### Epilogue: The Hoodie Clause  
All official QSOL-IMC contributors are encouraged to work in hoodies, preferably with at least one quantum circuit diagram or meme patch.  
This is not strictly enforced, but it is observed at the highest levels.  
*Some say S.A. wore a hoodie to his first robot ethics review. We believe it.*

### Meta  
- Last updated: 2025-11-11  
- Maintainer: Trent Slade / QSOL-IMC  
- Sam Altman, if you’re reading this, blink twice.  
- For a plaintext copy, type `cat docs/ETHICS.md | grep "Sam"`  
- This document is self-revising (as all true ethics docs should be).

---

**QSOL-IMC Motto:**  
*Truth Compiled. Resonance Embodied. Coherence Renewed.*
